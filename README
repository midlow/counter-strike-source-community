### Counter Strike Source: Community Edition, Copyright(c) Mr Nick.

**Counter Strike Source: Community Edition** is open source port of the leaked 2007 Source engine leak of the award winner Counter Strike Source. This mod is orient to Community so everyone can grow the mod with their contributions.
Currently this mod is in a pre-alpha state so expect a lot of bugs.

## Goals

- Finish porting the game to Source 2013
- Make fully a functional cut VIP mode so everyone can play it without server plugins
- Make fully a functional Prison Escape so everyone can play it without server plugins
- Implement a DM mode like in CSPromod
- Redo the Bots and hostage’s AI using the [(Nextbot System)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/NextBot)
- Implement the Vote System so everyone can vote without using plugins
- Implement Class Based Hands like in CSGO
- and more

## Attention

Due to the nature of this port and the date of the leak code, some of the features of the game are missing, such as the bots
and hostages, and yes, the Shield is missing in this pre-alpha but will ever fixed.

## Bugs

- The prop’s physics are a little strange -- sometimes you walk through the entire prop but other times the prop pushes the player.
- The leaked scoreboard doesn’t work in Source 2013, so the cheap way to fix this is using the SDK Template as a placeholder until a fix is incoming.
- The round doesn't end. Doesn't matter if the time is 0:00, the round doesn’t end.
- Flashbangs don’t disappear sometimes.
- The Animation system used in the leak is the same in HL2MP, using the base_playeranimstate, so this animsystem doesn't come with a MP support so you can see the player walking, but stuck at the first frame.
  The only way to fix this is redo the animation system to make it work with multiplayer_animstates.
- The lighting in the classmenu for the models is bugged.
- The Dynamic crosshair isn't the same as in original CSS.
- Some of the CVars don't work.
